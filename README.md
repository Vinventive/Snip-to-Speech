# Snip-to-Speech
Snip-to-Speech is an app made in Python that lets you take a snapshot of any part of your computer screen. It pulls out any text from that snapshot and then reads it out loud using Microsoft's default text-to-speech engine. You can use this app to easily extract text from an image or video as well.

`Press Ctrl + C + C to quickly snip the screen. (Note: There is a known bug where pressing the shortcut while the cursor is active inside any input field could freeze or crash the app. To prevent this, click outside the input field to deactivate typing before snipping. )`
